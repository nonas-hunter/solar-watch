# Solar Powered Watch
Author: Luke Nonas-Hunter

Create a highly power efficient digital watch based on the STM32. The watch charges using a built in solar panel on the face of the watch. The user can wake-up the watch by shaking their wrist and then use swipe gestures to control the watch. The watch also has NFC capabilities which will allow it to mimic an RFID tag and also recieve data from a separate device. 

Learning Goals:
 - Explore embedded systems.
 - Increase fluency in C coding language.
 - Gain experience working with the STM32.
 - Practice good PCB design.
